### Problem

Now you can use two styles of diagram sorting and renumbering in Word
Report.

### Solution

1.  To achieve the first style, choose in the Word Reporter
    wizard **"Sort diagrams by attributes"** in the window **"Advanced
    sorting"**.  
    Specify here usable properties (attributes) and choose the order of
    sorting - changes will be immediately shown in the lower diagram's
    treeview.

    On the next window of the wizard **"Diagram", **you can choose
    diagrams for reporting. Diagrams are presented in a straight line
    order, grouped only by units.

    The index of contexts of the final report will be created in this
    way:  
    Diagrams are numbered in order of sorting condition.  
    Objects are not numbered and presented as bullet-style paragraphs.

2.  To achieve the second style, choose in Word Reporter
    wizard **"Generate the diagram tree"** in the window **"Advanced
    sorting"**.  
    Now diagrams are shown in treeview in the same style as in the
    repository.  
    No sorting condition can be chosen.

    On the next window of the wizard **"Diagram",** you can choose
    diagrams for reporting.  
    Diagrams are presented in tree style (as in the repository), grouped
    by units.

    The Index of contexts of the final report will be created in this
    way:  
    Diagrams are numbered in order of position in the diagram tree.  
    Objects are not numbered and presented as bullet-style paragraphs.
