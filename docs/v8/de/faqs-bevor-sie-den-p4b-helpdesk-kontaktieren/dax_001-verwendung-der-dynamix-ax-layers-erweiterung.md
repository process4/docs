#### Checkboxes and attributes of layers:

-   Suppose that object **ActivitiesMain (Aktivit√§tsdetails)** has three
    filled layers - **SYS**, **SYP** and **GLS**:

-   Note checkbox positions for that layers in our "Dynamix AX layers"
    extension:

Algorithm is simple:

1.  Check all filled layers
2.  Collect data for that layers from "Dynamix AX layers" extension -
    first row means 1, second - 2 etc (for example: it is 3 for **SYS**
    layer, 2 for **SYP** and 1 for **GLS**).
3.  Choose maximum data for filled layers (in our case: for **SYS**,
    **SYP** and **GLS**) - it is 3. Note that **VAP** layer set to value
    4, but it is not used because appropriate attribute is not filled in
    our object.
4.  It means that 3 stairs in ladder will be filled on diagram (for this
    object).
