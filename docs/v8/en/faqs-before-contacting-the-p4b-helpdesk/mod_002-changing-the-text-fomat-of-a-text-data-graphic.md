### Solution

Open the master shape. Select **View - Master Shape Explorer Window**
(in Visio 2013+ go to **Developer** - **Drawing Explorer**). In the
window you can see all sub-shapes of the current shape. Select the shape
which contains the text data graphic and change its shape and/or
direction.
