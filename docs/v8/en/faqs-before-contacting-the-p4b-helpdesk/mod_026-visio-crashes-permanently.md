### Problem

Visio crahses permanently if you work in process4.biz

### Reason

Process4.biz is not compatible with some Visio Add-Ins like "Bluetooth"
for example. Installing process4.biz and some the other Visio Add-Ins
can lead to some problems, e.g. Visio crashes.

### Solution

If some Add-Ins which can cause problems are installed, a special
warning informs you about it:

All installed Visio Add-Ins are also listed in the mail generated if you
click on the button "**Report a problem**".

Visio 2010 SP3 disables the bluetooth Add-in
