When creating/updating a web publication, the following error appears:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Starting Visio worker process ...</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Cannot access the process4.biz-Add-In in the Visio background process. Probably this is caused by some security or configuration settings which are preventing this access. Please contact <a href="mailto:helpdesk@Process4.biz">helpdesk@Process4.biz</a> or ask for support. Process4.biz: Exception error occurred.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

**Possible causes**

-   A new Visio version was installed 
-   The process4.biz Add In was deactivated 

 

**Troubleshooting**

Uninstall Process4.biz and install it again so that all necessary
registry entries are created correctly.

Also you can try to run p4b as a different user on the same computer to
see if the problem is in some user settings.
