### Problem

You want to establish a connection to the SQL Server via another port
than the default tcp port (1433).

### Solution

In DbConfig enter the server name (as usual) in the field **Database
server **followed by a **comma** and then the number of tcp port that
you want to use. The default tcp port is 1433.
