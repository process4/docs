If the option "Export of Diagram Properties" is selected
(see Publication Settings), a window to select the diagram properties
appears in the next window. Diagram properties are sorted (similarly to
object properties) by unit, and sorted within units by diagram classes
(see [class](class)). System diagram properties are marked in orange.

User-defined property groups and properties are highlighted in blue and
can be specific to a unit or a diagram class. Select the diagram
properties that should be listed in Word report.
