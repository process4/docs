A dependency diagram shows the links of an object. They are created as
follows.

-   Select an object whose links you want to display, right-click on the
    context menu to open it and select the function ***new dependency
    diagram.***
-   First enter the name of the diagram. A name such as "dependency
    diagram for" Activity2" is automatically given. When you create a
    dependency diagram for several objects, a name such as "multiple
    selection for the dependency diagram" is proposed automatically.
-   Then select the class of the diagram.

-   In the following window you can indicate the number of levels to be
    displayed (= number of link levels of "predecessors + successors"
    and their "predecessors + successors", etc.). 
-   Finally, the displayed objects can also be deselected or selected
    individually based on the predecessors and successors of the
    respective levels for the dependency diagram. The class of objects
    is displayed in brackets. By default, all objects are drawn on the
    new diagram automatically.

-   A Visio window follows where you can select a format template.

-   You can also "update" the dependency diagram when the object for
    example has been linked with new objects. Open the diagram and
    right-click on the object whose linked objects you want to add for
    the display of the dependencies. From the context menu chose add
    linked objects. Finally, the dependency diagram wizard appears,
    where newly linked objects are already activated and the objects
    already used in the diagram are deactivated.

After you click ***Finish,*** these newly linked objects are added to
the diagram.
