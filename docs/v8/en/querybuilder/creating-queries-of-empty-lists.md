It is also possible to get a list of EMPTY properties in the
QueryBuilder; e.g. of objects that do NOT have object links or objects
that are NOT used on any diagram, etc.   
To get an empty list, create a query and activate additional option
"Enable empty lists" in the properties window on the left.   
Enabling this option means that additional items are listed, e.g.
objects that have NO linked objects.

If you enable this option, then the list will show both objects that
have links and objects without links to other objects. If you want to
display in the list only objects with empty values (i.e. without links)
(without simultaneously displaying the objects with values), set the
condition "is empty" for the column "Linked object" (i.e. {Link} -&gt;
{LinkedObject}).
