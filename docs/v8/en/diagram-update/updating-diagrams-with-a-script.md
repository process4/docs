If you want to apply a "\*.vbs" script for your diagrams, you can do it
with a special Wizard:

In the script window you can first choose the script in "\*.vbs" format
and if necessary create the backup copies of the changed diagrams.

In the next step you can choose stencils (.vss) and templates (.vst),
where the script should be applied.

And then the diagrams that you want to update with the script.
