The language properties dialogue can be opened in the object properties
dialogue of each object, when you click on the small button with the
three dots , which appears between each selected property (left) and its
associated expression (right). 

 

The available languages are shown on the left in the dialogue box for
language properties, and you can translate the terms in the right
column.

To translate an entire model, it is recommended that you use the Excel
Import-Export & PowerPoint Manager, which is a separate extension with
compulsory separate licensing.
