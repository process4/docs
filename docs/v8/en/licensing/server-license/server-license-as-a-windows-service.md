By default, the server license service is configured so that it must be
started manually. That is deliberately chosen so as to allow the entry
of the license key before the service starts. 

However, to make your job easier, we recommend to set the startup type,
after entering the license key, to "automatic". For this purpose the
usual Windows-board resources can be used with no great effort.

In the Computer Management open the Services list and find in the list
installed service (License as Windows Servace...). By clicking right
mouse button on this service open its properties and in the opened
window change startup type from Manual to Automatic and press button
*Start*.
