## Overview

Each data-object can have linked tasks. All those tasks have properties
(such as executor, description, due date etc.). Each task from p4b can
be linked with task in exchange. To do this exchange, integration should
be enabled and correctly configured. Also, task executor should be a
valid exchange user (his e-mail in exchange server should be
specified).Â
