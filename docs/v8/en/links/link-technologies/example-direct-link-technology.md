When you activate the direct link technology between a class (in the
example below: "Process") and any target classes via "linked to" AND
"linked from", all objects of this class can be DIRECTLY linked with
objects of all other classes.

The direction of the link is determined in the direct link by the
direction of the connector of the two objects in the diagram. You attach
the arrow between the objects to the shape in order to create the direct
links allowed for this class and its direction:

as an entry in the features selected via the context menu of the two
objects under the tab Object links:
