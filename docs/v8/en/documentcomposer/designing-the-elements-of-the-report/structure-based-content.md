The creation of this kind of documents with the DocumentComposer enables
a nearly automatic generation of the structure. This is calculated from
the diagrams and one or more classes of objects.

This screenshot shows the structure of the diagram quality management,
on this diagram are objects of the class process and process group.

In the report, a structure should now be created from the process
objects automatically. For this purpose I choose first the Start
diagram, in this example it is the quality management. Then which class
is to be taken as a structure is defined. The Wizard calculates the
structure and displays it. The attached diagrams are displayed too and
are automatically added with other properties to the report.

Here is another excerpt of the report that shows the table of contents,
this shows the structure.
