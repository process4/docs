This extension module provides all the necessary functions to publish
easily and adaptably on the web the model you created with process4.biz.

For the creation of a web portal, an available (IIS or Apache) is
necessary; the WebPublisher includes the automatic installation and
configuration of IIS. The WebPublisher uses ASP (or PHP) by default as
the script language for web publication. For the installation and
configuration of PHP, contact
the [helpdesk](FAQs_before_contacting_the_p4b-Helpdesk), if necessary.
You can make your content available of course as a simple HTML
publication; in this case, no IIS is necessary.

We recommend at least the browser IE8 (with necessary Adobe SVG Viewer
plug-in), or better IE9, which already has a native SVG viewer for
optimal viewing of the models on the Web. If you are using IE8 or IE9,
we recommend that you disable the compatibility mode. Since process4.biz
version 5.3.1, the web portal is viewable not only  in Internet
Explorer, but also in other browsers such as Firefox, Opera, Google
Chrome, and Safari. Please note that different browsers need different
settings and could therefore block some links.
