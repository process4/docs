### Model Language

If you have defined your objects in multiple languages, please enter the
language (model content language), in which the content is to be
published to the portal.

### Unit Selection

Select the units whose content you want to publish. If you select a
specific unit, only objects and diagrams created in this unit are
published, i.e. no inherited objects. You can also publish content from
multiple units. In this case you might want to consider grouping objects
by units (see chapter grouping settings for objects).

#### Consider only these objects which exist on published diagrams

Enable this option if you want to publish only objects that appear on
diagrams. Links to objects and diagrams not existing in the publication
are displayed as "dead" links (provided that the option "Show only
"working" links (to published objects or diagrams)" is disabled in the
publication settings page 1).
