### Definition

A unit is a structure or hierarchy level in process4.biz. Units thus
serve as a container for the collection and allocation
of diagrams and [objects](object).

The structuring of the [repository](repository) is done in [Designer
Database](database-designer) by applying deep unit structures. This
process is similar to managing folders and files in Windows Explorer.

Units can be named as you wish, are in the bottom of the [navigation
window](repository) in the repository and comprise of a hierarchical
branch for data and one for diagrams as well as other branches for
subordinate = deeper child-units.

Data and charts from higher parent-units can be inherited in deeper
levels of hierarchy.
