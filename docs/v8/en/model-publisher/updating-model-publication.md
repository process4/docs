There are two possible options to Update publication: 
-	Publish the whole model: if this option selected whole model will be updated including modified and not modified settings. In this case, update publication process can take long time, especially for large database. 
-	Incremental publication: if this option selected, only modified data will be updated in the selected publication. In this case, update publication process will be faster and can be used to repair publication or finish the publication that was paused. 
-	
__Keep the previously as "Approved" published diagrams even if their current status in the Modeler is not anymore approved__
Enable this option if you want to publish diagrams in their last approved status, even if it is not “Approved” now.  Other settings regarding the management of approved/unapproved content in the web publication are described in [approval management](approval-management).

If you want to change publication settings then click __Next__ and change necessary settings. For the Incremental publication, new settings will be applied only to updated items. 
If you do not need to change publication settings then just click __Finish__ on current page and update publication process will start.
