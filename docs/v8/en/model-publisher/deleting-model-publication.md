To delete an existing publication, you need to start the Model Publisher extension and select Delete an existing publication(s) option on the start page of the wizard. On the next page of the wizard specify the path and subpath of the site where the publication to delete is stored. Mark the publications in the list that should be deleted and click __Finish__. 

When the process successfully finished the files of the web publication on the hard drive are deleted; this includes models, images, scripts and any other publication files.
