Begin working with the timeline diagrams by creating a special timeline
template. The template should be named with the filename ".timeline" at
the end, e.g. "p4b\_Timeline.timeline.vst". Use as a model the
process4.biz timeline template, which you can find under the templates
for the demo model. The timeline template consists of the following
components:

The format, color, position and size of the shape can be changed. The
components should be named just like in the screenshot below:

Place the timeline template (\*vst) and the stencil (\*vss) in those
special folders where your templates are also placed for the database.
Create the path to this folder in the Designer in the properties of a
unit. Creating the timeline diagrams is only allowed for these units,
which also have a reference to appropriate folders that include such a
timeline template and a stencil.
