It is possible to
hide [units](unit), [classes](class), [objects](object) and [diagrams](diagram) as
well as data and diagram branches in selected units (or in all units) in
the database (and to show them again).

This feature is user-specific and can be used to simplify the model
structure optically; i.e. you can hide all those objects that are not
relevant to a user.

### Manage Visibility

To hide (or show again) an item, right-click in
the [repository](repository) or in the [Database
Designer](database-designer) on the item and choose in the context menu
"Manage Visibility". In the next window, you can define in which units
the selected item is to be visible or invisible.

-   When classes are hidden, they are also hidden in [Little
    Repository](graphical-visio-modeler), but they are not removed
    completely; i.e. you can still create new objects of a hidden class
    on diagrams by using the
    appropriate [shape](shapes-stencils-and-templates).
-   When a unit, a data-branch or a class (in the navigation tree) is
    hidden, then all objects of this unit or class are hidden in the
    repository (or in the Object Explorer).
-   When you create a child-unit for a hidden unit, this is also hidden.

To see which items are hidden for a user (for example to show them)
again, you can use the [unit filter](search-and-filters ).
