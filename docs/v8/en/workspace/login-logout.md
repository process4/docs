Without logging in a database, process4.biz cannot be used; therefore
the login window is displayed after start by default. If you have
started with Vision instead of with the process4.biz shortcut, the Login
button is displayed on the top left in the process4.biz menu strip.

<div class="info">
  <strong>Please note: </strong>

Each user is allowed to log in a database only once. When a user logs in
the same database for the second time (e.g. logs in another instance of
Visio), s/he is automatically logged out of the previously existing
Visio instance.

### Login

1.  Select Database  
    Here you select the database you wish to open. The selection box
    displays all the databases for which a connection profile was
    defined in DBConfig. In addition, it enables you to seek for
    databases and filter the choices accordingly.
2.  Username  
    Here the process4.biz user is entered, with which the login is to be
    performed. See also: Permissions
3.  Password  
    The password belonging to the registered user is entered in this
    field
4.  Optional: Use Windows NT integrated security  
    This option is designed to allow you to log into the database with
    the currently logged-in Windows user. Point 2 and 3 are greyed out
    in this case and the current Windows user must have the necessary
    permissions. See also: SQL-Login as Windows User

### Logout

Use the Logout command on the top left of the process4.biz menu to log
out of the currently open database.

Locked elements are available for editing by other users after the
Logout (optional).
