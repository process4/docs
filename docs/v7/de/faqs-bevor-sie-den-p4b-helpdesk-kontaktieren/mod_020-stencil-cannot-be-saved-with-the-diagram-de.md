## Problem

A diagram is always opened without stencil. Even if you open the stencil
for the diagram, save the diagram, than close it and open again, the
stencil is always lost. This problem appears not only in process4.biz,
but also if you open the diagram in Visio only.

## Solution

Open the ***Drawing Explorer Window*** from the Visio *Developer*
ribbon.

Open property of the diagram in the ***Drawing Explorer***. Under the
tab **Summary** activate the checkbox **Save workspace**.
