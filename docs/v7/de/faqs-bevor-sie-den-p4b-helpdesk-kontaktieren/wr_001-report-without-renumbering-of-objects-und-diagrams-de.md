### Problem

You want to create a Word Report, without renumbering objects and
diagrams. In this case you may use a self defined template.

### Solution

1.  In Word, open the file **word\_reporter\_template.dot** that you can
    find in the folder **C:\\Program Files
    (x86)\\process4biz\\Extensions\\process4.WordReporter\\**. Choose
    **"Styles and formatting"** in menu.

2.  In the window that appears you can define your own style for lists
    in the Word document. Put the cursor on a free place in the document
    (it is also better to click "enter" to create a new paragraph). Now
    you can choose your own style for each heading. In a Word Report
    document, the following headings are used:
    -   Style Heading 1 for "Summary"
    -   Heading 1 for the name of units and "Index of contents"
    -   Heading 2 for the name of diagram types
    -   Heading 3 for the names of diagrams
    -   Heading 4 for the names of objects.

3.  Choose the heading that you want to change and change it in the
    following way. To change from numbering to bulleted style:
    -   click the heading,
    -   click the bullets from the panel

        (you can select the bulleted style, by clicking
        **"Format/Bullets and Numbering"** and then select the desired
        style)
    -   choose for heading "Update..."  
        After all the changes, your list looks like this:

4.  Delete all paragraphs that you have created in Word template and
    that are no longer needed.
5.  Save this template as a new **document template**. Select this
    template during the creation of a new Word report.
