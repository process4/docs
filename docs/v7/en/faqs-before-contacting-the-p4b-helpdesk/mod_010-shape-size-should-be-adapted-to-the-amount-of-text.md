### Problem

You want a shape to change its size depending on theÂ quantity of the
text on it. For example, a text field should be max. 10 mm high, but if
more text is entered, the shape should "grow" along with the text
quantity.

### Solution

Open ***ShapeSheet*** for the master shape. In the section "**Shape
Transform**" select the field "**Height**" and enter
"TEXTHEIGHT(TheText,Width)".

If you want to fix the maximum size of the text field (i.e. 10 mm), you
have to enter "MAX(10 mm,TEXTHEIGHT(TheText,Width))"
