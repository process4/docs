After the Windows Administrator has started process4.biz once, a simple
Windows user can work with p4b.

Problem appears when

-   P4b is installed for the first time on a computer
-   Server License is installed
-   P4b is installed via \*msi file with parameters
-   Window user who starts p4b for the first time has no Admin rights

### Solution

Add this commandÂ to \*msi installation parameters:

"C:\\Programme\\process4biz\\Modeler\\P4B\_LicenseService.exe
QUIETEXIT".
