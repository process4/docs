If your file is corrupted because of Visio crash there are two ways to
recover it:

#### Solution 1:

1.  Change corrupted visio file extension to .zip i.e.
    from **myFile.vsdx** to **myFile.vsdx.zip** 
2.  Create a new folder
3.   Open the zip file and copy the contents into a new folder. 
4.  Create a new zip file with the contents of the folder (all extracted
    files and folders) 
5.  Rename the zip to a vsdx file. i.e. rename NewFolder.zip to
    myFile.vsdx 
6.  Try to open the new file with Visio. 
7.  If this didn't fix the corruption (it does work for some errors),
    then try the solution 2.

 

#### Solution 2:

1.  You will need the **WinRAR** application (free/trial version is ok) 
2.  Change corrupted visio file extension to .zip i.e.
    from **myFile.vsdx** to **myFile.vsdx.zip** 
3.  Click right mouse button on the zip file Click on "Repair archive",
    or press Alt+R.  
4.  Click on Browse button and select a folder where you want to keep
    the repaired archive.  
5.  There will be two options ("Treat the corrupt archive as RAR" and
    "**Treat the corrupt archive as ZIP**").  
6.  Select as **ZIP ** 
7.  Click on **OK **button. 
8.  Once done rename the new zip file by removing .zip i.e.
    rename **myFile.vsdx.zip** to **myFile.vsdx**
