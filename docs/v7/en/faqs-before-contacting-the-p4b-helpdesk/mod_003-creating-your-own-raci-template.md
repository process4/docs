### Problem

You want to create your own RACI template.

### Solution

**Option 1**

Create a RACI shape in a template and create a ***shape sheet*** for
each separate shape (R,A,C,I) with the ***user defined
cell***Â "*PhoenixObjectGUID*" which should contain the GUID of the
corresponding object.

**Option 2**

Create a shape with the name RACI, the class with the name RACI already
exists. If you place then separate objects of the class RACI (R, A, C,
I) on a diagram, the RACI template will be created. In this way you can
assign Function and Activity.
