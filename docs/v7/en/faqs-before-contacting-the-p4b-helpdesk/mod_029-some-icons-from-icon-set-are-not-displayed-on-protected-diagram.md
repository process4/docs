**Problem**

Some icons from Icon set are not displayed on protected diagram.

**Solution**

If diagrams were in **vsd** format, then this problem should not happen.
But if diagrams were already converted to **vsdx** format before build
30612, then run Diagram update wizard on affected diagram from
repository. This should fix the problem.
