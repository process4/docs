### Problem

If the size of the diagram is bigger than A4, the diagram is printed
from bottom to top and not from top to bottom.

### Solution

1. Turn on "Auto Size" for the diagram. So that all pages are shown.

2. Select all items on the diagram (Ctrl+A)

3. Move all shapes upwards so that they fit properly on the (first) page
which became visible now.

These actions can be automated via diagram update script provided by
p4b.
