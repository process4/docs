    bottom yellow message window, where you can also stop the process if
    necessary.

    results to Microsoft Excel. You can start the Excel Report Wizard
    also from the Ribbons Bar in Visio from the QueryBuilder menu.
4.  Select the desired query to be exported in the opened wizard. As
    another option, you can also transfer the names of the properties in
    the evaluation window to Excel, where they are used then as column
    headings, if you have selected the option Create column headers. If
    you then confirm by ***Next,*** an Excel report is generated based
    on the selected query and is automatically opened in Microsoft
    Excel. ![](//images.ctfassets.net/utx1h0gfm1om/3BYarceeVi8aicUeiomAMC/bb57af86b3505f413fa076e602ffc1f8/329265.png)
