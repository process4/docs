In QueryBuilder, you can list timeline objects with their properties and
display only objects that belong to a certain time interval by using
special conditions.   
If you create for example a query of objects of timeline classes and
their properties (Timeline\_TimeDuration, Timeline\_TimeBegin,
Timeline\_TimeEnd,...), you can define in the field condition for
timelines properties, whether the value should be "less than", "less
than or equal to", "more than","more than or equal to"," between", "not
between ". In other words, you are able to display in the
QueryBuilder only those objects that are in a certain time interval.
