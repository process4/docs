**Goal**: add new template to the list of existing templates

A list of existing templates can be viewed in **Repository**. In this
example, we have 4 existing templates:

We would like to add another one. To do this we navigate to Designer and
choose Manage the local templates:

A window showing all templates (and its stencils) will be shown. Note
there might be two template files with the same name, but they are
located in different folders depending on the language.

You now have two options, either copy (and edit) **existing** template
or open file explorer in order to add **new** template to the folder:

If we choose "Open in the file explorer", then a new explorer window
shows up, where we can add new templates. In our example we have added a
new template with the name **Business unit** (one file for template and
one for its stencil):

Now you can go to Repository view, click on "Refresh" button (it is
located right under "Repository" tab). Now you see that another template
is available for selection when creating a new diagram:

<div class="info">
Note: make sure you put your new template files in the right language
directory, i.e. if your modeler client language is German, then you have
to put your templates in the **/de/** folder. If your modeler language
is German and you put your templates only in **/en/** folder, then it
will not be updated.
</div>
