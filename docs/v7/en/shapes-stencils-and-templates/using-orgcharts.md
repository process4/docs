Visio Orgchart diagrams can now be used in process4.biz. To use this
functionality you need an orgchart template. You can copy Visio OrgChart
templates and stencils and add them to the list of process4.biz
templates. Note that this function can be activated only for built-in
Visio templates. You should see both tabs "Orgchart" and "Process4.biz"
in Visio.

Suppose you have a class ***position*** in your database. To enable the
integration, you should add Visio org-specific properties to this class.
You can activate ***add special properties*** in Designer using the
menu.

From now on Orgchart and Process4.biz are able to work together.

We have created the property ***"position type"*** with ***"Is master
shape = True"** for the class *position***.*** This property has the
following enumerator units that meet the orgchart-shape name:

Now if we drag a shape with this name from the Org chart stencils to the
diagram, it becomes the object with process4.biz Org chart properties.
When you change some values of Shape properties in the Org chart, they
are also changed in process4.biz and vice versa.
