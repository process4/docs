The following example on a diagram, creates in the repository an
automatic link of the type XY technology between the objects
"Application" and "Process1", and between "Application" and "Process2",
although they have no explicit connector (visible on the diagram) as
these objects intersect on the total space stretched by them. This
technology should be enabled between the classes "application" and
"process".

As the object "Process3" lies outside of the stretched surface, no link
is created to "Application". 

 

With regard to the creation of automatic link, the diagram of
process4.biz is analyzed in the above example and it is determined,
which objects of the two classes lay (even partially) on the red
bordered area. These objects are then registered as linked in the
database. As with the swimlane technology, partial overlap is suffices
here too.
