In this window you can select data objects and their properties to be
displayed in the report. Properties are grouped according to their
property groups. You can do this by selecting the desired classes,
property groups or properties.

If some classes are marked as grey, then these are currently not in the
report and therefore cannot be selected for export.

You can change the order of classes in the list via a property
"priority" (see [Creating a new Property](creating-a-new-property)).

Following the completion of the export process, MS Word will generate a
report with the exported diagrams and data objects.
