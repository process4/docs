Warning:

Please be aware that some properties and their values may be lost during
class changes. If for example Class "A" has the properties "A1" and "A2"
and you want to convert objects of the class "A" in the class "B"
(whereby Class "B" does not have the properties "A1" and "A2"), then the
properties "A1", "A2" and their values are lost. A special message
informs you on which properties will be lost during the change:
