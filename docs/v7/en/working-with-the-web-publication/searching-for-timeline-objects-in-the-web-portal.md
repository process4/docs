It is possible to search in the web portal for all objects that are
within a certain time interval. When you create a new Web publication,

This option allows for an advanced search for timeline objects. Here you
can define a period, to which the searched objects should belong, by
entering the start and end time.

Use the symbols "greater than", "less than" and "equal" to define the
period:&gt;,&gt; =, =, &lt;=, &lt;

The time format should be: 31.01.2001 or -3m, -2w, -1d.
