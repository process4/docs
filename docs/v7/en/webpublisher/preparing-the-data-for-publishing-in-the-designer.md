Before publishing, you can decide which objects and/or diagrams should
not be published. To do this, apply a special property "Disable for Web
publishing " in the Designer to those classes whose objects you do not
wish to publish.

You can also apply this property to the system classes Object and/or
Diagram so that it is shown for all objects and/or diagrams (see User
Manual, Chapter Automatically create special properties).  
Following this, you have the option to exclude objects and diagrams from
publishing, while at the same time you can edit their properties and set
the value of the  
property to TRUE in the Repository:

If you do not want to display some diagram and object properties or
property groups in the web portal, set their visibility value to "false"
in the Designer. They will be hidden in the web portal and also in the
process4.biz Repository.

In process4.biz each property has a property group Web Publishing with 1
property that allows you to manage the display of this property group in
Web Portal:

-   **Show in Web Publisher:**  
    If this property is set to True, the chosen property will be
    displayed in Web Portal in the object's or diagram's properties. If
    you do not want the property to be shown in Web Portal, set the
    value to False for it. E.g. property UUID. 

  
As a result, the object's properties in Web Portal will look like
this:

-   **Show tool tip in Web Publisher:**  
    If this property is set to True, the chosen property will be shown
    on diagrams as a tool tip, when you move a mouse over an object.
    Otherwise it will not be shown in tool tip.
