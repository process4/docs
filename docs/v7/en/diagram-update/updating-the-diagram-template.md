-   ***Replace the LOGO with one from the template*** - activate this
    option when you want to transfer the logo of the new template to
    other diagrams. You can use the ***old logo size*** (as it is in the
    diagrams) or the ***new logo size.*** The logo will only be replaced
    if it is on the background page.
-   ***Replace BACKGROUND page for diagrams with one from the
    template*** - activate this option to replace the background page of
    the diagrams with the background page of the template.
-   ***Replace FOREGROUND page for diagrams with one from the
    template*** - enable this option to replace the foreground page of
    the diagrams with the foreground page of the template. All shapes
    that are on the foreground page and are marked as a template item
    (see below) will be transferred to the diagrams. 
-   ***Apply template's SIZE  diagrams*** - activate this option to
    apply the original template size is to the diagrams. 
-   ***Add template's STENCILS to diagrams*** - select this option to
    add the stencils of the template to the diagrams. This option can be
    used for example if a diagram has "lost" your stencil and you want
    to restore it.  
-   ***Apply template's THEME to diagrams*** - activate this option to
    apply the theme of the template to the diagrams (You can change
    shape themes under the Visio menu *Format → Design).*
-   ***Replace the diagram's template name with the selected template
    name*** - All diagrams have the property "template name", indicating
    the name of the template under which the diagram was created. When
    this option is activated, the old template name is replaced with the
    new template name.
-   ***Replace the diagram's page name with the selected template page
    name*** - All diagrams and templates (\* vst) have one (or more)
    page names. When this option is activated, the page name of the
    diagram is replaced with the first page name of the template.
-   ***Remove the guide lines from diagrams***  
    This option removes all guides from diagrams during the replacement
    of the templates.
-   ***Mark shape as part of the template*** - for the exchange of
    shapes on the foreground the shapes must be marked as part of the
    template. To mark a shape as part of the template, open the template
    in process4.biz, select the shape, right-click and select *"Equip
    with p4b Properties → mark shape as part of the template".* A
    special entry is thus created in the ShapeSheet.
