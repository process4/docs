In the window "Diagram page properties", you can define the name of the
page. The page name can be translated into other languages. Via the
property ***Connected to process4.biz*** you can define whether shapes
that are used in this page should be process4.biz objects (with
corresponding properties) or pure Visio shapes. Via the
property ***Enable*** ***automatic linking***, you can define whether
automatic links should work on the page, or only on the main diagram
page.
