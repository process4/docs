### Named User License

The software is as often installed and unlocked as allowed by the number
of licenses purchased. You license the software for a certain number of
named users on certain workplaces and they can use the software on the
same physical LAN (Domain broadcast) at the same time. A Named User is
thus a client that is on a clearly identifiable PC in LAN and will be
granted access for the simultaneous database access together with other
multi-user clients.

<div class="info"> 
The Named User license is uniquely identifiable by the hardware
fingerprint, a code composed of various hardware and software components
of a real machine. Virtual machines cannot create a hardware
fingerprint.
  
  </div>

All extension modules are purchased separately per client.


### Concurrent User License

The software can be installed as many times you wish on PCs on the LAN
with the same domain broadcast,  whereby the maximum number of users
simultaneously accessing the same SQL Server User corresponds to the
legal licensing restrictions. You license the software for any number of
users, but only a certain maximum number can be logged in the p4b DB at
the same time on the same SQL Server to use the software. The named
specification of the user or the unique identification of certain PC
workstations are not required. Current users can thus be as many
installable and unlockable clients as you wish, whose limitation is
defined by the purchased number of clients who are allowed to access, in
the same broadcast domains on the p4b database(s), the  SQL server at
the same time.

This license form, which is attached to your domain, will function as
long as the computer is part of the specified domain. However
process4.biz will also function when the computer is not connected to
the network or when users are logged in as a local users and not as a
domain users.

### Concurrent Server License

The software is installed on any number of client computers existing
within domains that are in possession of the licensee. This type of
license requires the server license service to authenticate the p4b
clients.

<div class="warning">
  The use of virtual machines as well as the terminal server/Citrix access
is allowed only in the Concurrent Server licensing model.
  </div>

#### Server License Service

All other information on using and installing the server license
service, can be found here: Server license .

### Licensing of additional modules (Extensions)

Each extension module can be licensed under the named user license only
per PC = Client. On the contrary, under the Concurrent User or the
Concurrent Server license model each 1x purchased with 1 piece Extension
module is available for all clients and can be used throughout the
enterprise LAN by all users.

### Change of license models

When changing later from single- to multi-user operation, the cost of
single-user operation can be balanced later. The data and models can
still be used.

It is possible to change later from named users to the elevated
concurrent user/server license models, whereby the costs of the already
purchased Named User licenses can be calculated. The number of clients
must always remain the same and already purchased extension modules
cannot be canceled. A change is always only possible to elevated license
models.
