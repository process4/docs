### Basic Functionality of the Document Composer

The Document Composer, abbreviated DC, is another version of the
WordReporter. With the Document Composer, the structure of the document
(e.g. Quality Management Manual) can be defined, using a specific wizard
and published with the contents from the database (objects and
diagrams). Moreover, the content selected with QueryBuilder queries from
the database can be included.

The queries results vary according to the adaptation of the model and
these modified results can be incorporated automatically at defined
locations in the Word-based report. MS Word thus serves as the output
format for a collection of queries that have been created with the Query
Builder, and in which the individual queries can be designed flexibly
with parameters, so that e.g. general report content can be enriched
(controlled via variables) with specific results. A good example for
this are job descriptions or various quality management manuals that can
be created comfortably with the Document Composer together with the
Query Builder.


### Installing the Document Composer

To install the Document Composer on your computer, choose the necessary
parameters in the [process4.biz installation](installation-requirements). The Document Composer is available from the Modeller 5.4.0.

### Opening the Document Composer

The Document Composer can be started from the menu band, where you can
find extensions and then the Document Composer option:

### Language Selection for the Document Composer and the content

You must be logged in in one of the databases. The GUI (Graphical User
Interface) is displayed in the language that you selected in the global
p4b settings. These can be found in the Visio menu:  
Process4.biz -&gt; Client settings ...  
You can also determine the language in which the database content will
be exported to Microsoft Word.

Before you start the DocumentComposer, make sure that all Word documents
are closed, so that you avoid possible errors that may occur while you
edit the document.
